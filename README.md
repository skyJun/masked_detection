# Mask Detection with ResNet50 and EfficientNet

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a mask detection model to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The initiative was driven by the need to ensure compliance with public health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. By utilizing deep learning models such as ResNet50 and EfficientNet, we aim to achieve accurate and efficient mask detection.

## Models

### 1. **ResNet50**
   - A deep residual network consisting of 50 layers.
   - Solves the degradation problem using residual learning with identity mappings.
   - Pretrained on ImageNet for faster convergence.

### 2. **EfficientNet**
   - Employs a compound scaling method for depth, width, and resolution.
   - More computationally efficient than ResNet50 while achieving higher accuracy.

## Optimization Techniques

- **Weight Decay**: Prevents overfitting by keeping model weights small.
- **AdamW Optimizer**: Decouples weight decay from gradient updates for consistent regularization.
- **Pretraining**: Leverages ImageNet-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction.

## Performance Evaluation

- Models were trained with varying hyperparameters (`Î»_norm` values).
- ResNet50 showed stable learning and validation accuracy.
- EfficientNet exhibited better accuracy but required more data and epochs for optimal performance.

## Results

- **ResNet50**:
  - Validation Accuracy: ~76%.
  - Fast training due to smaller parameters but limited in handling diverse data.

- **EfficientNet**:
  - Superior performance in training metrics with potential for improvement with more data.
